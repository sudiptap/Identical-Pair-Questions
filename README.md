# Identical-Pair-Questions
Kaggle challenge for finding identical pair of questions
Identical-Pair-Questions predicts whether a given a pair of questions are identical or not. Details about this project can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs . Please find the training and test datasets on https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data . My implementation for this challenge consists of bits and pieces of many ideas collected from Kaggle kernels and many open source blogs and tutorials. 

Steps to Run
------------
1. download the datasets from kaggle website provided above.
2. For smooth execution place the datasets in the same directory as the code.
3. Install all dependencies required for execution. I have provided the list below.
4. Run question_pair_latest.py. The output is generated in the same directory. 

Dependencies:
-------------
Numpy, Pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib, Keras, tensorflow, gensim, nltk.
